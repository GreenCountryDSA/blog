The rise of market fundamentalism as an ideology to promote the neoliberal
agenda has reached worrying levels and it is looking to be consolidated with the current
administration. As a result, the heart of social democratic thinking—the idea that the
promise of each human being can only be developed in a society driven by principles of
liberty, equality, solidarity and cooperation—has been displaced by vicious and
erroneous principles of individualism, competition, deregulation, and privatization.

Scholars from all over the world—including Noam Chomsky, Joseph Stiglitz,
Rafael Correa, Cornel West—have started to challenge those ideas by exposing its
tremendous flaws. However, Green Country Democratic Socialists of America believes
that we must expand this endeavour to reach a wide audience. Therefore, we have
decided to embrace an educational role to revive the working class intellectual tradition.
We hope you enjoy the educational resources we are going to offer through our
approachable political education program, which includes [three educational series a
year](https://www.facebook.com/events/2079515272282077/) and an educational blog. It is time to challenge market fundamentalism and expose
the evils of the neoliberal political project.
